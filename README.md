This is a template repository for deno modules that want to use wasm. To use it simply click the
["Use this template"](https://github.com/denosaurs/wasabi/generate) button to generate a new repo
with all the stuff you need to get started writing rust and running it using wasm in deno.

## Prerequisites

- [deno](https://deno.land/)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)

## Structure

```
│  .gitignore     - A standard .gitignore file for ignoring build directories
│  Cargo.toml     - A file describing the rust library being built
│  LICENSE        - A standard license file you are free to change to fit your needs
│  mod.ts         - The entry point for the deno module
│  README.md      - This readme file
│  test.ts        - Containing tests
│  wasm.js        - A js file containing the built wasm and some glue code

├──scripts        - A directory for all development scripts
│   build.ts      - The build script for generating the wasm.js file
│
├──src            - The rust libraries source code
│   lib.rs        - The rust libraries entry point
│
├──pkg            - Ignored by .gitignore, used when building
│
└──target         - Ignored by .gitignore, used when building
```

## Building

```bash
$ deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run scripts/build.ts
```

OR

```bash
$ deno run -A scripts/build.ts
```

## Testing

Requires `wasm.js` to be built first.

```bash
$ deno test
```
